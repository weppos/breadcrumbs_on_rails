<tt>BreadcrumbsOnRails</tt> is a simple Ruby on Rails plugin for creating and managing a breadcrumb navigation for a Rails project. It provides helpers for creating navigation elements with a flexible interface.

## Requirements

- Rails 4 or Rails 5

For older versions of Ruby or Ruby on Rails, see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem "breadcrumbs_on_rails"

And then execute `bundle` to install the dependencies:

    $ bundle

Use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) and the `:git` option if you want to grab the latest version from the Git repository.


## Usage

Creating a breadcrumb navigation menu in your Rails app using <tt>BreadcrumbsOnRails</tt> is really straightforward.

In your controller, call `add_breadcrumb` to push a new element on the breadcrumb stack. `add_breadcrumb` requires two arguments: the name of the breadcrumb and the target path.

```ruby
class MyController

  add_breadcrumb "home", :root_path
  add_breadcrumb "my", :my_path

  def index
    # ...

    add_breadcrumb "index", index_path
  end

end
```

Take into account that if you define `add_breadcrumb` before or after a `before_action` filter, *matters*:

```ruby
class MyController

  add_breadcrumb "home", :root_path
  before_action :find_record
  add_breadcrumb "details", :record_details_path

  def find_record
    @record = Model.find params[:id]
    add_breadcrumb "record", record_path
  end

end
```

Will output `home > record > details`.

See the section "Breadcrumb Element" for more details about name and target class types.

The third, optional argument is a Hash of options to customize the breadcrumb link.

```ruby
class MyController
  def index
    add_breadcrumb "index", index_path, :title => "Back to the Index"
  end
end
```

In your view, you can render the breadcrumb menu with the `render_breadcrumbs` helper.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>
  <title>untitled</title>
</head>

<body>
  <%= render_breadcrumbs %>
</body>
</html>
```

`render_breadcrumbs` understands a limited set of options. For example, you can pass change the default separator with the `:separator` option.

```html
<body>
  <%= render_breadcrumbs :separator => ' / ' %>
</body>
```

Current possible options are:

- `:separator`
- `:tag`

To use with Bootstrap you might use the following:

```html
<body>
  <ol class="breadcrumb">
    <%= render_breadcrumbs :tag => :li, :separator => "" %>
  </ol>
</body>
```

More complex customizations require a custom `Builder`.

### HTML Escaping

The text of the breadcrumb is html-escaped by default unless it is a SafeBuffer, to prevent XSS attacks.

```ruby
class MyController
  add_breadcrumb "This is the <b>Main</b> page".html_safe

  def profile
    add_breadcrumb "#{@user_name} Profile", users_profile
  end
end
```

In this case, if `@user_name` is `<script>`, it will output:

    This is the <b>Main</b> page > &lt;script&gt; Profile


### Breadcrumb Element

A breadcrumbs menu is composed by a number of `Element` objects. Each object contains two attributes: the name of the breadcrumb and the target path.

When you call `add_breadcrumb`, the method automatically creates a new `Element` object for you and append it to the breadcrumbs stack. `Element` name and path can be one of the following Ruby types:

- `Symbol`
- `Proc`
- `String`

#### Symbol

If the value is a `Symbol`, the library calls the corresponding method defined in the same context the and sets the `Element` attribute to the returned value.

```ruby
class MyController
  
  # The Name is set to the value returned by
  # the :root_name method.
  add_breadcrumb :root_name, "/"
  
  protected
  
    def root_name
      "the name"
    end
  
end
```

#### Proc

If the value is a `Proc`, the library calls the proc passing the current view context as argument and sets the `Element` attribute to the returned value. This is useful if you want to postpone the execution to get access to some special methods/variables created in your controller action.

```ruby
class MyController

  # The Name is set to the value returned by
  # the :root_name method.
  add_breadcrumb Proc.new { |c| c.my_helper_method },
                 "/"

end
```

#### String

If the value is a `String`, the library sets the `Element` attribute to the string value.

```ruby
class MyController

  # The Name is set to the value returned by
  # the :root_name method.
  add_breadcrumb "homepage", "/"

end
```

### Restricting breadcrumb scope

The `add_breadcrumb` method understands all options you are used to pass to a Rails controller filter. In fact, behind the scenes this method uses a `before_filter` to store the tab in the `@breadcrumbs` variable.

Taking advantage of Rails filter options, you can restrict a tab to a selected group of actions in the same controller.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  add_breadcrumb "admin", :admin_path
  add_breadcrumb "posts", :posts_path, :only => %w(index show)
end

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  add_breadcrumb "admin", :admin_path, :if => :admin_controller?
  
  def admin_controller?
    self.class.name =~ /^Admin(::|Controller)/
  end
end
```

### Internationalization and Localization

<tt>BreadcrumbsOnRails</tt> is compatible with the standard Rails internationalization framework.

For example, if you want to localize your menu, define a new breadcrumbs node in your `.yml` file with all the keys for your elements.

```yaml
# config/locales/en.yml
en:
  breadcrumbs:
    homepage: Homepage
    first: First
    second: Second
    third: Third

# config/locales/it.yml
it:
  breadcrumbs:
    homepage: Homepage
    first: Primo
    second: Secondo
    third: Terzo
```

In your controller, use the `I18n.t` method.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  add_breadcrumb I18n.t("breadcrumbs.first"),  :first_path
  add_breadcrumb I18n.t("breadcrumbs.second"), :second_path, :only => %w(second)
  add_breadcrumb I18n.t("breadcrumbs.third"),  :third_path,  :only => %w(third)
end

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  add_breadcrumb I18n.t("breadcrumbs.homepage"), :root_path
end
```
